# NES Controller Port

This is a KiCad library for the NES Controller port. The part can be found on
[zedlabz.com](https://www.zedlabz.com/products/controller-connector-port-for-nintendo-nes-console-7-pin-90-degree-replacement-2-pack-black-zedlabz?_pos=8&_sid=b3d25e834&_ss=r).

The dimensions are based on this image, that I found on
